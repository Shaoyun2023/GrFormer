🔍Highlights
---
● **Manifold Attention Mechanism**  
First embedding of Grassmann subspaces into Euclidean attention networks for multimodal structural/semantic fusion in manifold space.  

● **Hierarchical Subspace Disentanglement**  
Low-rank subspace mapping to decouple high/low-frequency image components with manifold-constrained cross-modal relation learning.  

● **Dynamic Mask-Enhanced Fusion**  
Learnable mask tensors for foreground-background separation to amplify cross-modal complementary interactions.  

● **SOTA-Surpassing Performance**  
Qualitative and quantitative performance breakthroughs on established benchmarks.
